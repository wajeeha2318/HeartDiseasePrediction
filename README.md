# HeartDiseasePrediction
Heart disease prediction using dataset from Kaggle.
In this project applied multiple machine learning algorithms to determine which is better suited for heart disease prediction. A total of 14 features were used.
The algorithms which were applied are: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier.
Later applied Neural Network to demonstrate it's working from conventional machine learning models.
