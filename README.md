# HeartDiseasePrediction
# Overview
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using a dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to determine the most effective machine learning algorithm for heart disease prediction by applying and comparing several models. The project uses a dataset with 14 features to train and evaluate various algorithms, including both traditional and neural network-based approaches..

# Features
1. Dataset: Utilizes a Kaggle dataset containing 14 features related to heart disease.
2. Machine Learning Models Applied:
    * Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
    * Support Vector Machine (SVM): A model that finds the optimal hyperplane for classification.
    * Decision Tree: A model that splits data into subsets based on feature values.
    * Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
    * Neural Network: Demonstrates the use of a neural network to compare its performance with traditional machine learning models.

# Methodology
1. Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the dataset to ensure it is suitable for model training.
2. Feature Selection: Use 14 features from the dataset for training the models.
3. Model Training and Evaluation.
4. Comparison of Models.
